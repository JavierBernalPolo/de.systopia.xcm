#**CiviCRM Extended Contact Matcher (XCM)**

Creates an API action ```Contact``` » ```getorcreate``` that will return a contact Id for the input parameters. First a search is done for the given contact (see settings in Installation section below), and if that's not conclusive a new contact will be created.

Only the contact id is returned.

The settings page offers lots of options such as:

- determining how contacts are matched.
- recording an activity when contacts are created/updated
- adding contacts to groups or adding a tag.


##**Installation**

Install in the usual way (e.g. download the [[**latest**]](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm/releases) release or clone this repository into your CiviCRM extensions directory, then go to Administer » System Settings » Extensions, click Refresh then it should show up and you can click Install.)

Then go to Administer » Adminstration Console » Xtended Contact Matcher Settings (/civicrm/admin/setting/xcm) to visit the settings panel. **At the very least you need to visit that settings page and add a rule, or the extension will always create new contacts.**


##**Usage**

Let's say this person is not in your database:

```$result = civicrm_api3('Contact', 'getorcreate', array(
        'first_name' => "Wilma",
        'last_name' => "Flintstone",
        'email' => "wilma@example.com",
        ));
// $result['id'] = 1234```


They are now. Do the same thing again:


```$result = civicrm_api3('Contact', 'getorcreate', array(
        'first_name' => "Wilma",
        'last_name' => "Flintstone",
        'email' => "wilma@example.com",
        ));
// $result['id'] = 1234```


They were found and no duplicate contact was created.
